## Cocoon Crescendo

Magdalyn Wong, Lisa Shen, Adriana Castillo

Our game, Cocoon Crescendo, is inspired by the classic snake game. It is a 3D game that allows the user to control a caterpillar with the left and right arrow keys to grow cumulatively in length by eating. At first, the player is presented with a vivid background that introduces the name of the game and a start button. Once the ‘start’ button is pressed, the clouds fade into the background as a transition into the game. The game presents a leaf as the platform, a caterpillar that is on the leaf, a cherry, and a power-up. 
Collectibles include cherries and a power-up. Each cherry will earn the player 2 points and 2 new bodies. The core experience of the game aims to give users a relaxed and soothing atmosphere that allows users to play casually. The game increases in complexity as the body of the caterpillar grows with the platform staying the same, thus, the user has to be extra cautious to not run into its body. However, the power-up offers a challenge to the user, as it is meant to speed up the game. Each time a power-up is collected, the caterpillar permanently increases in speed by 1 and a random number of bodies in the range of 3 to 5 is added. Each added body part will equal 1 point. The power-ups are catered to users who enjoy a more fast-paced environment. The game ends when the caterpillar's head touches one of its body parts or moves off of the leaf platform. 
The game is designed to be intuitive, allowing users to understand the mechanics by themselves because of the simplicity of the design. The visual design is kept rather simple and is meant to invoke a sense of nostalgia for earlier games. The font and music that we chose echo this sentiment. The game ends with an end scene that allows the player to either play again or return to the home screen.
